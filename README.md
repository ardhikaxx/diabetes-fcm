# Diabetes Severity Classification using Fuzzy C-Means and Neural Network

## 📋 Overview
This project implements a hybrid approach combining **Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering** and **Neural Networks** to classify the severity of diabetes in patients. Unlike traditional binary classification, this system provides fuzzy membership degrees representing how strongly a patient belongs to each severity category.

## 🎯 Features
- **Fuzzy Logic Integration**: Uses FCM for soft clustering of diabetes severity
- **Deep Learning Model**: PyTorch-based neural network for classification
- **Severity Scoring**: Continuous severity scores from 0 (healthy) to 1 (critical)
- **Interpretable Results**: Provides fuzzy membership degrees for each cluster
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Visualizations, metrics, and patient profiles
